        <h1>Newsletter</h1>
        <p>
            Every two weeks I send out a newsletter containing lots of interesting stuff for the modern PHP developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expect quick tips, links to interesting tutorials, opinions and packages. Because I work with Laravel every
            day there is an emphasis on that framework.
