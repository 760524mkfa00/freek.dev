    <h1 class="pb-4 border-b">Newsletter</h1>
    <p class="pt-6">
        Every two weeks I send out a newsletter containing lots of interesting stuff for the modern PHP developer. You
        can expect quick tips, links to interesting tutorials, opinions and packages. Because I work with Laravel every
        day there is an emphasis on that framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        Want to know what you're getting yourself into? Here's <a
                href="https://sendy.murze.be/w/db6bg1gpZgjCkCxhjltj4g">a previous
            edition</a>.
    </p>

    @include('front.newsletter._partials.form')

    <p>
        Rest assured that I will only use your email address to send you the newsletter and will
        not use it for any other purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every edition of the newsletter contains one or two sponsored links. Hereâ€™s <a href="/advertising">some more
            info</a> on that.
